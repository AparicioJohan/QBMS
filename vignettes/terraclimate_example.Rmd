## QBMS
Linking data management systems to analytics is an important step in breeding digitalization. Breeders can use this R package to Query the [Breeding Management System](https://bmspro.io/) database (using [BrAPI](https://brapi.org/) calls) and help them to retrieve their experiments data directly into R statistical analyzing environment.

## TerraClimate
[TerraClimate](https://www.climatologylab.org/terraclimate.html) is a dataset of monthly climate and climatic water balance for global terrestrial surfaces from 1958-2019. These data provide important inputs for ecological and hydrological studies at global scales that require high spatial resolution and time-varying data. All data have monthly temporal resolution and a ~4-km (1/24th degree) spatial resolution. The data cover the period from 1958-2020. We plan to update these data periodically (annually).

## BrAPI
The Breeding API ([BrAPI](https://brapi.org/)) project is an effort to enable interoperability among plant breeding databases. BrAPI is a standardized RESTful web service API specification for communicating plant breeding data. This community driven standard is free to be used by anyone interested in plant breeding data management.

## _Install_
```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("icarda-git/QBMS")
```

## _Example_
```r
# load the QBMS library
library(QBMS)

data <- get_climate(36.016, 36.943, '1979-09-01', '2012-06-30')

View(data$climate)

View(data$biovars)

```
## _Troubleshooting the installation_

1. If the installation of QBMS generates errors saying that some of the existing packages cannot be removed, you can try to quit any R session, and try to start R in administrator (Windows) or SUDO mode (Linux/Ubuntu) then try installing again.

2. If you get an error related to packages built under a current version of R, and updating your packages doesn’t help, you can consider overriding the error with the following code. _Note: This might help you install QBMS but may result in other problems. If possible, it’s best to resolve the errors rather than ignoring them._

```r
Sys.setenv("R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS" = TRUE)

remotes::install_github("icarda-git/QBMS", upgrade = "always")
```
